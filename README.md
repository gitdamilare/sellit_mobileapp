# SellIT Mobileapp (Educational Purpose)
 This mobile application is a personal project for a course I took during my Master's program. The aplication was built on the Flutter framework powered by Dart and the backend api was written in NodeJs.

Some of the design used in this application was modelled from Olx and N26 mobile application.
